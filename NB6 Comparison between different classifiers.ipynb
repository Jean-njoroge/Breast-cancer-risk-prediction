    "Worked through a classification predictive modeling machine learning problem from end-to-end using Python. Specifically, the steps covered were:\n",
    "1. Problem Definition (Breast Cancer data).\n",
    "2. Loading the Dataset.\n",
    "3. Analyze Data (same scale but di↵erent distributions of data).\n",
    "    * Evaluate Algorithms (KNN looked good).\n",
    "    * Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization (KNN and SVM looked good).\n",
    "4. Algorithm Tuning (K=19 for KNN was good, SVM with an RBF kernel and C=100 was best).. \n",
    "5. Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset)"
